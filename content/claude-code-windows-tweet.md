**Tweet 1 (Hook):**

🚀 Just set up Claude Code on Windows and it's a GAME CHANGER

Here's the exact setup that took me from zero to AI-powered coding in 15 minutes:

🧵👇

---

**Tweet 2:**

First: Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

Open PowerShell as admin:
```
wsl --install
```

Restart your PC.

That's it. You now have Linux on Windows. 🐧

---

**Tweet 3:**

Next: Install Node.js in WSL

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 20
```

Takes about 2 minutes ⚡

---

**Tweet 4:**

Now the magic - Install Claude Code:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Set your API key:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-xxxxx"
```

Get key from: console.anthropic.com

---

**Tweet 5:**

Run it:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/You/Projects/your-app
claude
```

Now you have an AI that can:
✅ Read your entire codebase
✅ Edit files directly
✅ Run commands for you
✅ Debug issues autonomously

---

**Tweet 6:**

Pro tip: Don't work from /mnt/c (slow)

Clone to Linux home instead:
```bash
cd ~
git clone your-repo
claude
```

10x faster file operations 🚀

**Tweet 7:**

Some things I've built with Claude Code this week:

• Full REST API in 20 mins
• Debugged a memory leak I'd been stuck on for days
• Wrote 50+ unit tests
• Refactored legacy code safely

It's like having a senior dev on call 24/7

---

**Tweet 8:**

Cost breakdown:

• API: ~$0.10-$1 per session
• Claude Pro ($20/mo): Includes usage
• Claude Max ($100/mo): Heavy users

ROI is insane. Time saved > money spent.

**Claude Code on Windows: My Setup Guide**

I've been using Claude Code for the past few weeks and it's transformed how I write code.

Unlike ChatGPT in a browser, Claude Code runs IN your terminal and can directly edit your files, run commands, and understand your entire project structure.

Here's my Windows setup (takes ~15 minutes):

**1. Install WSL**
```
wsl --install
```
(restart required)

**2. Install Node.js**
```
nvm install 20
```

**3. Install Claude Code**
```
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**4. Run it**
```
claude
```

That's it. Now you have an AI pair programmer that:
• Reads and edits files directly
• Runs terminal commands
• Debugs issues autonomously
• Understands your entire codebase

The productivity gains have been significant. Tasks that took hours now take minutes.
